## @use

The *@use* rule loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together. Stylesheets loaded by *@use* are called "modules". Sass also provides built-in modules full of useful functions.

The simplest *@use* rule is written `@use "<url>"`, which loads the module at the given URL. Any styles loaded this way will be included exactly once in the compiled CSS output, no matter how many times those styles are loaded.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads up!**<br>
> A stylesheet‚Äôs *@use* rules must come before any rules other than *@forward*, including style rules. However, you can declare variables before *@use* rules to use when configuring modules.


SCSS
```scss
// foundation/_code.scss
code {
  padding: .25em;
  line-height: 0;
}
```

```scss
// foundation/_lists.scss
ul, ol {
  text-align: left;

  & & {
    padding: {
      bottom: 0;
      left: 0;
    }
  }
}
```
```scss
// style.scss
@use 'foundation/code';
@use 'foundation/lists';
```

CSS
```css
code {
  padding: .25em;
  line-height: 0;
}

ul, ol {
  text-align: left;
}
ul ul, ol ol {
  padding-bottom: 0;
  padding-left: 0;
}
```


### Loading Members
You can access variables, functions, and mixins from another module by writing `<namespace>.<variable>`, `<namespace>.<function>()`, or `@include <namespace>.<mixin>()`. By default, the namespace is just the last component of the module‚Äôs URL.

Members (variables, functions, and mixins) loaded with *@use* are only visible in the stylesheet that loads them. Other stylesheets will need to write their own *@use* rules if they also want to access them. This helps make it easy to figure out exactly where each member is coming from. If you want to load members from many files at once, you can use the *@forward* rule to forward them all from one shared file.

> üí° **fun fact**<br>
> Because *@use* adds namespaces to member names, it‚Äôs safe to choose very simple names like *$radius* or *$width* when writing a stylesheet. This is different from the old *@import* rule, which encouraged that users write long names like *$mat-corner-radius* to avoid conflicts with other libraries, and it helps keep your stylesheets clear and easy to read!


SCSS
```scss
// src/_corners.scss
$radius: 3px;

@mixin rounded {
  border-radius: $radius;
}
```
```scss
// style.scss
@use "src/corners";

.button {
  @include corners.rounded;
  padding: 5px + corners.$radius;
}
```

CSS
```css
.button {
  border-radius: 3px;
  padding: 8px;
}
```

#### Choosing a Namespace
By default, a module‚Äôs namespace is just the last component of its URL without a file extension. However, sometimes you might want to choose a different namespace‚Äîyou might want to use a shorter name for a module you refer to a lot, or you might be loading multiple modules with the same filename. You can do this by writing `@use "<url>" as <namespace>`.


SCSS
```scss
// src/_corners.scss
$radius: 3px;

@mixin rounded {
  border-radius: $radius;
}
```
```scss
// style.scss
@use "src/corners" as c;

.button {
  @include c.rounded;
  padding: 5px + c.$radius;
}
```

CSS
```css
.button {
  border-radius: 3px;
  padding: 8px;
}
```


You can even load a module without a namespace by writing `@use "<url>" as *`. We recommend you only do this for stylesheets written by you, though; otherwise, they may introduce new members that cause name conflicts!


SCSS
```scss
// src/_corners.scss
$radius: 3px;

@mixin rounded {
  border-radius: $radius;
}
```

```scss
// style.scss
@use "src/corners" as *;

.button {
  @include rounded;
  padding: 5px + $radius;
}
```

CSS
```css
.button {
  border-radius: 3px;
  padding: 8px;
}
```

#### Private Members

As a stylesheet author, you may not want all the members you define to be available outside your stylesheet. Sass makes it easy to define a private member by starting its name with either **-** or **_**. These members will work just like normal within the stylesheet that defines them, but they won‚Äôt be part of a module‚Äôs public API. That means stylesheets that load your module can‚Äôt see them!

> üí° **fun fact**<br>
> If you want to make a member private to an entire package rather than just a single module, just don‚Äôt forward its module from any of your package‚Äôs entrypoints (the stylesheets you tell your users to load to use your package). You can even hide that member while forwarding the rest of its module!


SCSS
```scss
// src/_corners.scss
$-radius: 3px;

@mixin rounded {
  border-radius: $-radius;
}
```
```scss
// style.scss
@use "src/corners";

.button {
  @include corners.rounded;

  // This is an error! $-radius isn't visible outside of `_corners.scss`.
  padding: 5px + corners.$-radius;
}
```


### Configuration

A stylesheet can define variables with the !default flag to make them configurable. To load a module with configuration, write `@use <url> with (<variable>: <value>, <variable>: <value>)`. The configured values will override the variables‚Äô default values.


SCSS
```scss
// _library.scss
$black: #000 !default;
$border-radius: 0.25rem !default;
$box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default;

code {
  border-radius: $border-radius;
  box-shadow: $box-shadow;
}
```

```scss
// style.scss
@use 'library' with (
  $black: #222,
  $border-radius: 0.1rem
);
```

CSS
```css
code {
  border-radius: 0.1rem;
  box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.15);
}
```


#### With Mixins

Configuring modules with *@use ... with* can be very handy, especially when using libraries that were originally written to work with the *@import* rule. But it‚Äôs not particularly flexible, and we don‚Äôt recommend it for more advanced use-cases. If you find yourself wanting to configure many variables at once, pass maps as configuration, or update the configuration after the module is loaded, consider writing a mixin to set your variables instead and another mixin to inject your styles.


SCSS
```scss
// _library.scss
$-black: #000;
$-border-radius: 0.25rem;
$-box-shadow: null;

/// If the user has configured `$-box-shadow`, returns their configured value.
/// Otherwise returns a value derived from `$-black`.
@function -box-shadow() {
  @return $-box-shadow or (0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($-black, 0.15));
}

@mixin configure($black: null, $border-radius: null, $box-shadow: null) {
  @if $black {
    $-black: $black !global;
  }
  @if $border-radius {
    $-border-radius: $border-radius !global;
  }
  @if $box-shadow {
    $-box-shadow: $box-shadow !global;
  }
}

@mixin styles {
  code {
    border-radius: $-border-radius;
    box-shadow: -box-shadow();
  }
}
```

```scss
// style.scss
@use 'library';

@include library.configure(
  $black: #222,
  $border-radius: 0.1rem
);

@include library.styles;
```


#### Reassigning Variables

After loading a module, you can reassign its variables.


SCSS
```scss
// _library.scss
$color: red;
```

```scss
// _override.scss
@use 'library';
library.$color: blue;
```

```scss
// style.scss
@use 'library';
@use 'override';
@debug library.$color;  //=> blue
```

This even works if you import a module without a namespace using as `*`. Assigning to a variable name defined in that module will overwrite its value in that module.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads up!**<br>
> Built-in module variables (such as *math.$pi*) cannot be reassigned.


### Finding the Module

It wouldn‚Äôt be any fun to write out absolute URLs for every stylesheet you load, so Sass‚Äôs algorithm for finding a module makes it a little easier. For starters, you don‚Äôt have to explicitly write out the extension of the file you want to load; `@use "variables"` will automatically load `variables.scss`, `variables.sass`, or `variables.css`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads up!**<br>
> To ensure that stylesheets work on every operating system, Sass loads files by URL, not by file path. This means you need to use forward slashes, not backslashes, even on Windows.


#### Load Paths

All Sass implementations allow users to provide load paths: paths on the filesystem that Sass will look in when locating modules. For example, if you pass `node_modules/susy/sass` as a load path, you can use `@use "susy"` to load *node_modules/susy/sass/susy.scss* (although pkg: URLs are a better way to handle that).

Modules will always be loaded relative to the current file first, though. Load paths will only be used if no relative file exists that matches the module‚Äôs URL. This ensures that you can‚Äôt accidentally mess up your relative imports when you add a new library.

> üí° **fun fact**<br>
> Unlike some other languages, Sass doesn‚Äôt require that you use `./` for relative imports. Relative imports are always available.


#### Partials

As a convention, Sass files that are only meant to be loaded as modules, not compiled on their own, begin with `_` (as in *_code.scss*). These are called partials, and they tell Sass tools not to try to compile those files on their own. You can leave off the `_` when importing a partial.


#### Index Files

If you write an `_index.scss` or `_index.sass` in a folder, the index file will be loaded automatically when you load the URL for the folder itself.


SCSS
```scss
// foundation/_code.scss
code {
  padding: .25em;
  line-height: 0;
}
```

```scss
// foundation/_lists.scss
ul, ol {
  text-align: left;

  & & {
    padding: {
      bottom: 0;
      left: 0;
    }
  }
}
```

```scss
// foundation/_index.scss
@use 'code';
@use 'lists';
```

```scss
// style.scss
@use 'foundation';
```

CSS
```css
code {
  padding: .25em;
  line-height: 0;
}

ul, ol {
  text-align: left;
}
ul ul, ol ol {
  padding-bottom: 0;
  padding-left: 0;
}
```



### pkg: URLs

Sass uses the pkg: URL scheme to load stylesheets distributed by various package managers. Since Sass is used in the context of many different programming languages with different package management conventions, pkg: URLs have almost no set meaning. Instead, users are encouraged to implement custom importers (using the JS API or the Embedded Sass protocol) that resolve these URLs using the native package manager‚Äôs logic.

This allows pkg: URLs and the stylesheets that use them to be portable across different language ecosystems. Whether you‚Äôre installing a Sass library via npm (for which Sass provides a built-in pkg: importer) or the most obscure package manager you can find, if you write @use 'pkg:library' it‚Äôll do the right thing.

> üí° **fun fact**<br>
> pkg: URLs aren‚Äôt just for *@use*. You can use them anywhere you can load a Sass file, including *@forward*, *meta.load-css()*, and even the old *@import* rule.


#### Rules for a pkg: Importer

There are a few common rules that Sass expects all pkg: importers to follow. These rules help ensure that pkg: URLs are handled consistently across all package managers, so that stylesheets are as portable as possible.

In addition to the standard rules for custom importers, a pkg: importer must only handle non-canonical URLs that:

- have the scheme pkg, and
- whose path begins with a package name, and
- are optionally followed by a path, with path segments separated with a forward slash.

The package name may contain forward slashes, depending on whether the particular package manager supports that. For example, npm allows package names like @namespace/name. Note that package names that contain non-alphanumeric characters may be less portable across different package managers.

pkg: importers must reject the following patterns:

- A URL whose path begins with /.
- A URL with non-empty/null username, password, host, port, query, or fragment.

If pkg: importer encounters a URL that violates its own package manager‚Äôs conventions but not the above rules, it should just decline to load that URL rather than throwing an error. This allows users to use multiple pkg: importers at once if necessary.

#### Node.js Package Importer

Because Sass is most widely-used alongside the *Node.js* ecosystem, it comes with a pkg: importer that uses the same algorithm as Node.js to load Sass stylesheets. This isn‚Äôt available by default, but it‚Äôs easy to turn on:

- If you‚Äôre using the JavaScript API, just add new *NodePackageImporter()* to the importers option.
- If you‚Äôre using the Dart API, add NodePackageImporter() to the importers option.
- If you‚Äôre using the command line, pass --pkg-importer=nodejs.

If you load a pkg: URL, the Node.js pkg: importer will look at its package.json file to determine which Sass file to load. It will check in order:

- The "exports" field, with the conditions "sass", "style", and "default". This is the recommended way for packages to expose Sass entrypoints going forward.
- The "sass" field or the "style" field, which should be a path to a Sass file. This only works if the pkg: URL doesn‚Äôt have a subpath‚Äîpkg:library will load the file listed in the "sass" field, but pkg:library/button will load button.scss from the root of the package.
- The index file at the root of the package This also only works if the pkg: URL doesn‚Äôt have a subpath.

The Node.js pkg: importer supports the full range of "exports" features, so you can also specify different locations for different subpaths (note that the key must include the file extension):

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "sass": "styles/index.scss",
    },
    "./button.scss": {
      "sass": "styles/button.scss",
    },
    "./accordion.scss": {
      "sass": "styles/accordion.scss",
    }
  }
}
```

‚Ä¶or even patterns:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "sass": "styles/index.scss",
    },
    "./*.scss": {
      "sass": "styles/*.scss",
    },
  }
}
```


### Loading CSS

In addition to loading *.sass* and *.scss* files, Sass can load plain old *.css* files.


SCSS
```css
// code.css
code {
  padding: .25em;
  line-height: 0;
}
```

```scss
// style.scss
@use 'code';
```

CSS
```css
code {
  padding: .25em;
  line-height: 0;
}
```

CSS files loaded as modules don‚Äôt allow any special Sass features and so can‚Äôt expose any Sass variables, functions, or mixins. In order to make sure authors don‚Äôt accidentally write Sass in their CSS, all Sass features that aren‚Äôt also valid CSS will produce errors. Otherwise, the CSS will be rendered as-is. It can even be extended!


### Differences From @import

The *@use* rule is intended to replace the old *@import* rule, but it‚Äôs intentionally designed to work differently. Here are some major differences between the two:

- **@use** only makes variables, functions, and mixins available within the scope of the current file. It never adds them to the global scope. This makes it easy to figure out where each name your Sass file references comes from, and means you can use shorter names without any risk of collision.

- **@use** only ever loads each file once. This ensures you don‚Äôt end up accidentally duplicating your dependencies‚Äô CSS many times over.

- **@use** must appear at the beginning your file, and cannot be nested in style rules.

- Each **@use** rule can only have one URL.

- **@use** requires quotes around its URL, even when using the indented syntax.
