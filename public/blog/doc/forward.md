## @forward

The **@forward** rule loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its mixins, functions, and variables available when your stylesheet is loaded with the **@use** rule. It makes it possible to organize Sass libraries across many files, while allowing their users to load a single entrypoint file.

The rule is written `@forward "<url>"`. It loads the module at the given URL just like **@use**, but it makes the public members of the loaded module available to users of your module as though they were defined directly in your module. Those members arenâ€™t available in your module, thoughâ€”if you want that, youâ€™ll need to write a **@use** rule as well. Donâ€™t worry, itâ€™ll only load the module once!

If you do write both a **@forward** and a **@use** for the same module in the same file, itâ€™s always a good idea to write the **@forward** first. That way, if your users want to configure the forwarded module, that configuration will be applied to the **@forward** before your **@use** loads it without any configuration.

> ðŸ’¡ **fun fact**<br>
> The **@forward** rule acts just like **@use** when it comes to a moduleâ€™s CSS. Styles from a forwarded module will be included in the compiled CSS output, and the module with the **@forward** can extend it, even if it isnâ€™t also **@used**.


SCSS
```scss
// src/_list.scss
@mixin list-reset {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
```

```scss
// bootstrap.scss
@forward "src/list";
```

```scss
// styles.scss
@use "bootstrap";

li {
  @include bootstrap.list-reset;
}
```

CSS
```css
li {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
```

### Adding a Prefix

Because module members are usually used with a namespace, short and simple names are usually the most readable option. But those names might not make sense outside the module theyâ€™re defined in, so **@forward** has the option of adding an extra prefix to all the members it forwards.

This is written `@forward "<url>" as <prefix>-*`, and it adds the given prefix to the beginning of every mixin, function, and variable name forwarded by the module. For example, if the module defines a member named reset and itâ€™s forwarded as `list-*`, downstream stylesheets will refer to it as list-reset.


SCSS
```scss
// src/_list.scss
@mixin reset {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
```

```scss
// bootstrap.scss
@forward "src/list" as list-*;
```

```scss
// styles.scss
@use "bootstrap";

li {
  @include bootstrap.list-reset;
}
```


CSS
```css
li {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
```


### Controlling Visibility

Sometimes, you donâ€™t want to forward every member from a module. You may want to keep some members private so that only your package can use them, or you may want to require your users to load some members a different way. You can control exactly which members get forwarded by writing `@forward "<url>" hide <members...>` or `@forward "<url>" show <members...>`.

The hide form means that the listed members shouldnâ€™t be forwarded, but everything else should. The show form means that only the named members should be forwarded. In both forms, you list the names of mixins, functions, or variables (including the $).


SCSS
```scss
// src/_list.scss
$horizontal-list-gap: 2em;

@mixin list-reset {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}

@mixin list-horizontal {
  @include list-reset;

  li {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: {
      left: -2px;
      right: $horizontal-list-gap;
    }
  }
}
```

```scss
// bootstrap.scss
@forward "src/list" hide list-reset, $horizontal-list-gap;
```

### Configuring Modules

The **@forward** rule can also load a module with configuration. This mostly works the same as it does for **@use**, with one addition: a **@forward** ruleâ€™s configuration can use the **!default flag** in its configuration. This allows a module to change the defaults of an upstream stylesheet while still allowing downstream stylesheets to override them.

SCSS
```scss
// _library.scss
$black: #000 !default;
$border-radius: 0.25rem !default;
$box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default;

code {
  border-radius: $border-radius;
  box-shadow: $box-shadow;
}
```

```scss
// _opinionated.scss
@forward 'library' with (
  $black: #222 !default,
  $border-radius: 0.1rem !default
);
```

```scss
// style.scss
@use 'opinionated' with ($black: #333);
```
